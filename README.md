# Robofly_simulator
This repo is for devloping a 3D simulator for flapping wing robots on python. The controller is originaly written by Dr. Sawyer B. Fuller, coverted to python by Daksh Dhingra.

# Installation
Required libraries for running the controller

- numpy
- control
- csv
- matplotlib
- scipy

# Files 
- 'controller.py' - class with lateral and altitude controller methods
- 'robot.py' - class defining the dynamics of roboFly. Contains methods for calculating drag force and drag torque calculation.
- 'simulator.py' - Simulator class containing methods for plot, save data and ODE solver.
- 'test.py' - main fuction to define initial and desired state and call ODE solver.
- 'load_and_plot.py' - script used to plot the saved data.
